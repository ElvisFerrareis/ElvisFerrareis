- 👋 Hi, I’m @ElvisFerrareis
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, like:
  - develop (I could do that in C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python; and can try in: VB.Net, Delphi, Linux ShellScript, PowerShell);
  - work with data (from design databases to analyze data), I know a little SQL and worked with MSSQL Server, Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL,
      doing some analizes using Excel, Power BI, Python and Qlik Sense;
  - math;
  - physics;
  - ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Power BI, JavaScript/TypeScript and always fiding new ways to make what I already knew!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can, but I'm shy to just go to a other persisn's repository and and make a pull request.
